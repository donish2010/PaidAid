IMPLEMENTED FEATURES

Minimum Requirements -
1. We implemented web services for retrieving usernames and passwords and storing users usernames,
   passwords, and emails. We also used web services for displaying fake (hard-coded) requests on the
   requests feed. (home screen)

2. We implemented Registration and Sign-In options. To register, you click the "Sign up now!"
   button and proceed with typing in your desired username, email, and password. If you already
   have an account, you can sign in with your username and password. For validation, we check to
   make sure the username is not empty, check to make sure the email is valid by using the given
   built in PHP email validator (must have @ sign), and then the password must be 7+ characters long.


3. The user stories we implemented are:
    - As a non-registered user, I want to be able to register with Paid Aid, so that I can access all
      the app has to offer.
    - As a user, I want to be able to log into Paid Aid, so I can access all of Paid Aids features.
    - As a user, I want to be able to swipe through the requests, so that I can view all of the posted
      requests.
