This phase of your project must meet the following minimum requirements.

1. Uses web services to retrieve or store data for the app.
Your app must retrieve data from the web service that you build.
It could be a list page that’s using the web service just as we retrieved the course
list using an Android AsyncTask in the labs. If your app doesn’t need to retrieve any
data, you must store data using a web service that you build. Start on the web service
portion early so that you can get the php help timely.

2. Provides Registration and Sign-In with custom account or using a social media account.
Your app must allow the user to register and login if you implement custom login.
This should be fully functional with validation and proper navigation.
If implementing social media account login, make sure to provide a test account.
If using Facebook login, login under Facebook Developers, go to application, Roles,
on top navigation for tabs, click Test Users and add. We suggest installing the apk file
on a different tester’s device to test. They should use the account information provided
to login. This will ensure that we can test your app and run it successfully.

3. You must implement at least one (or more) other high priority user story (stories) that
is (are) important for your project other than the ones listed above. Your source code must have
javadoc for all the methods and comments for any obscure code. Use good naming conventions for
packages and components within your project. Java coding conventions must be followed that you
learned in the past courses. Remove all TODOs. Make sure that each java file has a header with
the information for each class.

FOR TEACHER

1. Your source code folder zipped up (Not just the app folder but the entire project folder).
2. README.txt file
a. Lists the features implemented including the minimum
b. Lists user stories from proposal that have been implemented
3. Create a class diagram that shows the current design for your project.
Show your Activity, Fragment and model classes in the design. Don’t show Android classes in the design.
Lucidchart is a good tool to create a class diagram.
