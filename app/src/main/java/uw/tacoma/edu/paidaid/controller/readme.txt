This phase of your project must meet the following minimum Android requirements

1. Fix any bugs from the previous phase that the instructor or peer reviewers found.
   Address how you incorporated (or didn’t) these changes in your README.txt file.

2. You must implement 90% of the use cases that you provided in your proposal. Talk to the
   instructor as to what you plan to leave out or add and document this in the README.txt file.

3. Your app must save data to the device’s storage using SQLite and one other storage mechanism
   (SharedPreferences or File Storage). Explain in your README.txt file as to where and why you
    used the data storage.

4. Your app must use web services to make the app functional. Using dummy data is not allowed
   for this phase. Explain in your README.txt file as to where and why you used web services.

5. Your app must use Content Sharing to send or receive information pertinent to the app. Content
   Sharing is sharing information from mobile devices via email, text messaging, or social media.
   Examples: Send a recipe using email, share top score on social media, etc. Explain in your
   README.txt file as to where we can find this.

6. Your app must allow Sign-In with custom accounts and/or using social media accounts. If you
   promised to do both then you should have them implemented for this phase. If implementing social
   media account login, make sure to provide a test account. If using Facebook login, login under
   Facebook Developers, go to application, Roles, on top navigation for tabs, click Test Users
   and add.

7. Your app uses graphics to display images – an icon for the app and a logo count as graphics.

8. You must write at least one JUnit class for a model class and at least one Instrumentation test
   to test a fragment/activity in your project. The tests need to be thorough not trivial. Your app
   must not crash when any of the options are chosen. Every crash on the app is a deduction on the
   overall project grade. I suggest installing the apk file on a different tester’s device to test.
   They should use the account information provided to login. This will ensure that we can test your
   app and run it successfully. Your source code must have javadoc for all the methods and comments
   for any obscure code. Java coding conventions must be followed that you learned in the past
   courses. Remove all TODOs. Make sure that each java file has a header with the information for
   each class.
